# SQL - Data Analysis
# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of a pizza sales dataset for a fictional pizza chain. The analysis leverages SQL to extract key business insights, understand performance trends, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a fictional pizza sales dataset. It comprises four interrelated tables:
* `orders` – details about each customer order including timestamps.
* `order_details` – breakdowns of each order by specific pizzas and quantities purchased.
* `pizzas` – price and size information for each pizza item.
* `pizza_types` – descriptions of each pizza by name, category (e.g., Classic, Veggie), and ingredients.

## Features
* Comprehensive SQL queries for data aggregation and analysis.
* Insights into daily revenue trends, top-selling pizzas, etc.
* Demonstrates skills in SQL joins, window functions, grouping, and data aggregation.

## Requirements
* A SQL database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
* The provided pizza sales dataset imported into your SQL database.

## Usage
* Set up your SQL database and load the provided dataset.
* Execute the SQL queries available in the `queries_and_results.md` file.
* Review the results to gain insights into pizza sales performance.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only. The dataset is fictional, and any resemblance to real business data is purely coincidental.
